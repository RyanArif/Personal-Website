					<h5>Programming Since 2013</h5>
					<p class="w3-text-grey">When I was just 13 years old, I discovered the joy of programming. I began my software development journey with LUA, in a video game called Garry's Mod. I created a custom server in Garry's Mod that rose to moderate popularity, and lead a community of awesome individuals. I later took as many programming classes as I could in High School, and learned the fundamentals of Java and C#. Currently I am taking C++ classes at TCC, and hope to transfer and graduate with a degree in Computer Science. You can view some of the developmental projects I've worked on below.</p>

					<p>In Spring 2019, I was required to maintain a blog as a part of a Technical English course at Tarrant County College. At first I thought it would be a drag, until I realized I would need to create a website for it. At first I took the lazy way and made it on Wix, but I have since changed my mind. I am currently working on the creation of the blog, and am excited to learn more about web development with it. Currently, the website is still hosted on Wix, though.</p>

					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<h5 class="w3-padding-32">I tutor math, and develop software.</h5>
					<p class="w3-text-grey">Since I was a child, I've loved math. It wasn't just about it being an easy class for me growing up - there was more to it. I always enjoyed the complicated relationships between different numbers and objects, and math was the key to learning about them.
          When I turned thirteen, I got into programming by openning a Gary's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town server. The game was programmed in LUA, which is where I learned to write my first functions. I would later take classes in High School where I learned to program in both Java and C#.
          Currently, I am a Mathematics/Computer Science dual major at Tarrant County College. I plan on transferring to a four year university in 2020.</p>
