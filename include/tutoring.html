					<h5>Learning Math: Done Right.</h5>
					<p class="w3-text-grey">We've all had a math teacher who made us think "Math is hard." Usually that teacher would have answered questions with "Because I said so," or "Because it just is," rather than explaining the ideas that build that lesson. All it takes is one bad teacher to start causing math trouble. When you're in math trouble, you'll fall deeper and deeper until you feel totally lost and helpless. However, help is in reach. I will help bring you up to the mathematics level you need to be at for success in High School or College.</p>
