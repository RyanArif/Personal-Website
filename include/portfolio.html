        <h5>TCC Webfolio Project</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          As a part of Technical Communcation at TCC, I was tasked with making a Webfolio. This project gave me the opportunity to update my website 
          and add a useful portfolio section. This portfolio contains all assignments worked on during the Technical Communication course.
          Once the class has been concluded, all work below will be replaced with relevant work, such as my public GitHub, and any other tools I have
          created, and will create.       
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          You can click each of the buttons below to read more about the projects, then click the underlined links to view them.
          All work within this website is my own, except for the CSS which is provided by w3 schools. Front-end design isn't my forte, so this
          CSS saves me time in web design.

        <p>In Spring 2019, I was required to maintain a blog as a part of a Technical English course at Tarrant County College.
          At first I thought it would be a drag, until I realized I would need to create a website for it. At first I took the lazy way and made it on Wix,
          but I have since changed my mind. I am currently working on the creation of the blog, and am excited to learn more about web development with it.
          Currently, the website is still hosted on Wix, though.</p>

          <p>As a part of Technical Communication, I was tasked with creating a resume. However, since I recently started looking for a new job,
            I already had a resume created. I instead took the time to properly update the resume, and follow better stylistic guidelines,
            such as listing all work and education in reverse chronological order. Hopefully these stylistic changes will improve my chances
            of getting future employers to notice me out of the other applicants.

        <a href="content/proposal.pdf" target="_blank"><h2 class="w3-hover-shadow w3-center">Proposal</h2></a>
        <p>As a part of Technical Communication, I was tasked with making a proposal of some sort for change within the college. My group decided
        on discussing the issue with textbooks and their outlandish pricing. We proposed moving away from paid textbooks and moving to
        free alternatives.</p>
        <p>During our initial research to decide if it was worth our time to even propose this change, we discovered monetary benefit for
        the colleges and professors who choose to use free alternatives. Hopefully, our research during our Recomendation Report would support us
        in getting this project approved.</p>

      <div id="recrep" class="proj w3-card-4 w3-center w3-light-grey" style="display:none">
        <div class="w3-light-grey w3-half" style="min-height:400px; padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px;">
          <a href="content/recrep.pdf" target="_blank"><h2 class="w3-hover-shadow w3-center">Recommendation Report</h2></a>
          <p>During this project we interviewed students and professors to determine the place of textbooks in the modern college setting.
            We ended up affirming our initial thoughts during the research conducted during our proposal project: Free resources are more beneficial to 
            students than paid textbooks.</p>
          <p>We ran into many obstacles. For most of us, this was our first college group project. We had previously worked in groups during high school,
            but college group work is totally different. Unlike in high school, we all have jobs and more serious work to get done, both in and out of 
            class. We ended up scheduling around any obstacles and got our work taken care of. This project was quite the learning experience!

          <p>As a part of our Recommendation Report, we were required to deliver a presentation to the class over the project. We haven't actually done 
            our presentation yet, so there's not much I can add to this. Once it's done, I will update this page!
