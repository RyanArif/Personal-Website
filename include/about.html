           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I tutor math, and develop software.</h5>
           <p class="w3-text-grey">Since I was a child, I've loved math. It wasn't just about it being an easy class for me growing up - there was more to it. I always enjoyed the complicated relationships between different numbers and objects, and math was the key to learning about them.
 When I turned thirteen, I got into programming by openning a Gary's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town server. The game was programmed in LUA, which is where I learned to write my first functions. I would later take classes in High School where I learned to program in both Java and C#.
 Currently, I am a Mathematics/Computer Science dual major at Tarrant County College. I plan on transferring to a four year university in 2020.</p>
